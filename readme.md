# Object guidelines

Javascript is not a class based language, is a multi paradigm programming language wich supports prototype based Object Oriented Programming (OOP) .
This gives us several different ways to work with objects.
But in general, the following guideline should be followed:

"Start with the simplest implementation and move to more complex implementations only as required:  
Functions > objects > factory functions > functional mixins > classes"

"You should always use the simplest possible abstraction to solve the problem youâ€™re working on. Start with a pure function. If you need an object with persistent state, try a factory function. If you need to build more complex objects, try functional mixins."  
<https://medium.com/javascript-scene/functional-mixins-composing-software-ffb66d5e731c>

I will try to generate examples and collect all the pro and cons of the different implementations and why we choose to follow the previous guideline.

## Functions

The functions should be pure functions:

- Each input combination correstpond to exactly one output.
- They only depend on the input data.
- They do not alter the input data. (Inmutability)

They should not produce any side effect, that means, they should not modify the state the program.

<https://codeburst.io/functional-programming-in-javascript-e57e7e28c0e5>

``` js
const square = {
  length: 10,
  breadth: 10
};

function getArea(square) {
  return square.length * square.breadth;
}

function printAll(square) {
  console.log(`length: ${square.length}`);
  console.log(`breadth: ${square.breadth}`);
  console.log(`area: ${getArea(square)}`);
}

printAll(square);
```

After ES6 we can write:

``` js
const square = {
  length: 10,
  breadth: 10
};

const getArea = square => {
  return square.length * square.breadth;
};

const printAll = square => {
  console.log(`length: ${square.length}`);
  console.log(`breadth: ${square.breadth}`);
  console.log(`area: ${getArea(square)}`);
};

printAll(square);
```

## Objects

In both following Objects examples we can see that we can define methods inside an object.  
Why would we do this?

``` js
const square = {
  length: 10,
  breadth: 10,

  getArea: function() {
    return this.length * this.breadth;
  },
  printAll: function() {
    console.log(`length: ${this.length}`);
    console.log(`breadth: ${this.breadth}`);
    console.log(`area: ${this.getArea()}`);
  }
};

square.printAll();
```

Thanks to ES6 we can avoid the function keyword and write instead:

``` js
const square = {
  length: 10,
  breadth: 10,

  getArea() {
    return this.length * this.breadth;
  },
  printAll() {
    console.log(`length: ${this.length}`);
    console.log(`breadth: ${this.breadth}`);
    console.log(`area: ${this.getArea()}`);
  }
};

square.printAll();
```

## Factory functions

As we cannot modify an already defined function without using dirty tricks, we can state that it is not possible to add Methods to a factory function after it was defined. All methods have to be defined within it. What we can do id add methods to an object generated by a factory function as we previously saw.

The next implementation is wrong. It will not only generate the factory function, but also it will put into the object a whole lot of other things that we dont need.

``` js
function Rectangle(length, breadth) {
  this.length = length;
  this.breadth = breadth;

  this.getArea = function() {
    return this.length * this.breadth;
  };
  return this;
}

const square = Rectangle(10, 10);

square.printAll = function() {
  console.log(`length: ${this.length}`);
  console.log(`breadth: ${this.breadth}`);
  console.log(`area: ${this.getArea()}`);
};

console.log(square);
console.log(square.getArea());
square.printAll();
```

This implementation is right.

``` js
const Rectangle = (length, breadth) => {
  return {
    length: length,
    breadth: breadth,
    getArea() {
      return this.length * this.breadth;
    }
  };
};

const square = Rectangle(10, 10);

square.printAll = function() {
  console.log(`length: ${this.length}`);
  console.log(`breadth: ${this.breadth}`);
  console.log(`area: ${this.getArea()}`);
};

console.log(square);
console.log(square.getArea());
square.printAll();

```

## Functinal mixins

Functional mixins are a data structure that provides a higher abstraction. They also provide true encapsulation. This is something that even classes fail to provide.

## Classes

There are two main ways of implementing classes in Javascript

### _Using a constructor function_

Note that in this context, the use of the __function__ keyword cannot be avoided, we cannot use arrow functions because the context is not passed properly with the __this__ keyword.  
Note2: Altough it looks similar, it is not the same as a factory function.

``` js
function Rectangle(length, breadth) {
  this.length = length;
  this.breadth = breadth;

  this.getArea = function() {
    return this.length * this.breadth;
  };
}

Rectangle.prototype.printAll = function() {
  console.log(`The length is: ${this.length}`);
  console.log(`The breadth is: ${this.breadth}`);
  console.log(`The area is: ${this.getArea()}`);
}

const square = new Rectangle(10, 10);
square.printAll();
```

Note that one of the methods was defined inside the definition of the function and another outside. This is just to show that this can be done.

### _Using the __class__ syntax introduced in ES6_

This is only syntactical sugar of what we did before.

Declaring the method inside the Object:

``` js
class Rectangle {
  constructor(length, breadth) {
    this.length = length;
    this.breadth = breadth;
  }

  getArea() {
    return this.length * this.breadth;
  };
}

Rectangle.prototype.printAll = function() {
  console.log(`The length is: ${this.length}`);
  console.log(`The breadth is: ${this.breadth}`);
  console.log(`The area is: ${this.getArea()}`);
};


const square = new Rectangle(10, 10);
square.printAll();
```

Just as before one of the methods was defined inside the definition of the function and another outside to show how this can be done.

## Inheritance in Javascript

Composition is harder with classes.  
<https://medium.com/javascript-scene/why-composition-is-harder-with-classes-c3e627dcd0aa>

The use of classes increases the complexity(wich makes the code more error prone) and rigidity(wich amplifies the probability of breaking changes through inheritance) of the code.
